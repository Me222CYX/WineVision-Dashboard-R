This week we improved on our R dashboard. We added additional tabs, tidied our “learn more” page, and improved styling and app layout. 

We began work on a Prediction tab, but were unable to get it to a production-ready state in time and have chosen to separate it into a “future additions” page in order to give users an idea of the direction this dashboard could take in the future. We realized that this feature would require many techniques not covered in class and not easily solved on the internet. In particular, getting plots to show on the dashboard which are generated from packages other than plotly and ggplot proved to be difficult. Our idea was to try and generate a png or html image from the graph and then embed this into the dashboard. We couldn’t quite figure out a way to update this image using callbacks, and decided to devote the rest of the time we had to improving everything else instead.

A lot of the feedback we received on our earlier iteration was how busy our app looked. Our overview page was a wall of text which worked to immediately turn users away from trying to use the app. We addressed this by cutting down the word count substantially to only include necessary information, and separating the page into a couple of tabs. This way, users could easily find whatever information they are looking for and learn what they need to know in a few sentences.

We also learned from feedback that sometimes it is necessary to reduce the functionality of visualization software to make it more user-friendly and focused on a specific goal. In our earlier version, we had a page dedicated to comparing the chemical properties of red wine and white wine. This made for a busy and hard to read correlation matrix plot, as each correlation required overlaid graphics for red and white wines. In the end we removed the functionality of comparing red and white wines entirely, as it is not relevant to our main goal of predicting quality. Our new page generates correlation matrix plots for a single wine type at a time, and looks much cleaner.

We received some feedback from our presentation that it is not immediately obvious what the purpose of the app is, so it was important to us to ensure that every page worked toward the goal of predicting quality. We also altered our presentation to include a use case to show potential users a specific problem that could be solved using our dashboard.
